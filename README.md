# Image_Processing_FInal_Project
Final Project for DSC 481 Image Processing at DePaul University

Project that I completed during fall quarter 2022. I attempted to create an algorithm that took 2x2 (and also built to be flexible with 3x3) square puzzle piece puzzles and put the pieces in order based on edge matching. There are many other efficient puzzler alogrithms out there which will be future state of this process but this class went over how to manipulate images in order to use them later for machine learning.
